# Role & Permission Management System

This project is a **Role and Permission Management System** built using **Laravel 12**, **Sanctum**, and a **customized version of the Spatie Permission package**. It is designed to manage users, teams, roles, and fine-grained access to products within a multi-team architecture.

## ðŸ”§ Architecture Overview

### 1. Super Admin
- Has full access to all parts of the system.
- Can create teams and assign roles within them.

### 1-a:
- The super admin can create teams and define their internal roles.

### 2. Teams
Each team has three predefined roles:
- **Admin**
- **Editor**
- **Viewer**

#### 2-a:
- All three roles can **view** the products accessible to the team.

#### 2-b:
- Only **Admins** and **Editors** can **edit** the products related to the team.

#### 2-c:
- Any user who has **Admin** or **Editor** role in at least one team can **create** a product specifically for that team.

### 3. Users
- A user can belong to multiple teams.
- A user can have different roles in different teams.

### 4. Super Admin Permissions
- The Super Admin can grant specific users access to individual products for viewing, regardless of team memberships.
